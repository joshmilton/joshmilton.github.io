  <h2 style ="text-align: center;">Interactivity</h2>

  <h2>Interactive Notation</h2>
  <p>Creating a genuine interface for notational interaction is a key feature enabling for authentic engagement with music learning through multimedia. The rationale and design of this feature is discussed in detail in the <a href="design-choices.html">Design Choices</a> page.</p>


   <h2>Creation Workflow</h2>
  <p>Through discussions with colleagues, several ideal features were identified which would allow for efficient creation of music education multimedia content.</p>
  <ul style="line-height:130%">
  <li>Importation of MusicXML (notation format) rather than images for notation</li>
  <li>Editable settings for the display of notation (e.g. sections, length, animation, MIDI playback)</li>
  <li>Ability to use a keyframe system to add notation over footage, as well as control parameters such as highlighting and focus areas.</li>
  <li>Audio mixing control for MIDI and in-video sound.</li>
  <li>A simple interactive editor which can utilise sections of imported notation or be used to build notation directly within the editor. o	This should also allow for creation of instant feedback for answers such as common wrong answers or the correct answer.</li>
  <li>Ability to export notation inputted by students (e.g. student writes a bar of music inbetween two existing bars) for further direct feedback from teachers.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <p>As mentioned in our goals, increasing accessibility to the creation of multimedia via the platform was a must (See page: <a href=”goals.html”>Goals</a>).  This need for the proposed platform to allow a high level of control over the multimedia content while keeping the creative process and workflow as simple as possible was supported through the discussions I had with my colleagues.</p>

  <p>The below image (See Figure 9) shows what a notation editor with these types of features might look like for this multimedia platform, simple and configurable. This allows for the editor to hide individual notes or features of the notation, as well as toggle settings related to MIDI playback, animation and length.</p>
