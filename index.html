 <! Introduction Section>
  <h2 style="text-align:center">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Throughout my time as a music educator and student, it has been abundantly clear to me that there is a lack of a prevailing format for presentation of digital music education content within both practical tutorial content (videos showing how to play a specific song) and conceptual teaching content (videos explaining theoretical concepts). Through this project and further study I hope to outline a clear set of guidelines based on CTML to support the development of effective Music Education multimedia content.</p>
  <p>As a music educator working in the online distance education space, multimedia content forms a large part of the instructional design of our courses - thus it is important that the multimedia content within these courses is engaging and enables student learning. While many platforms exist for creation of interactive multimedia content, such as the H5P framework (H5P Group, n.d.), these platforms lack functionality which is key to authentic Music education.</p> 
  <p>For this assessment task I have explored and critically evaluated the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer & Moreno, 1999) and the application of this work to the realm of Music Education. </br></br></p>
  <p>Using the principles of CTML I have proposed a design for a multimedia platform focusing on Music education content. This has been done as a means of improving upon Music education practices in the digital space through clearer instructional design and improved accessibility and interactivity for students, and a simplified creation process for teachers and instructional designers.</p>
