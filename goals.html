  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Goals</h1>
  <p>I approached the project with several goals, a brief description of each of the core goals is available below.</p>

</br>

<h2>Goal One: Interpret CTML principles in a Music Education Space</h2>
<p>While the core principles of CTML are a fantastic basis for developing multimedia content in most instructional settings, the unique nature of music requires a deeper look at the core principles of the framework to ensure that they are used in a manner that supports student learning in this context.</p>
<p>While some literature does exist regarding the application of CLT to Music education, such as Owens & Sweller’s (2008) study “Cognitive load theory and music instruction”, there are large gaps still present in applying the CTML framework to music education which must be considered when approaching music education through the lens of CTML. This study was also conducted on inexperienced or novice musicians with little knowledge of music practices, so is likely to differ from the educational experiences of more expert musicians.</p>
<br>
<h2>Goal Two: Introduce authentic interactivity to Music multimedia</h2>
<p>While the core principles of CTML are a fantastic basis for multimedia learning, the complex nature of music and music notation means that traditional activity types such as inputting an answer in a verbal form is not directly comparable to common music skills such as writing notation, transcribing melody and rhythm, or annotating harmonic progressions. The notation in the multimedia should be interactable on a meaningful level, as it might be in a basic notation program – users should be able to input notes, select individual objects, and hear playback of their answers via MIDI.</p>
<p>There are currently no platforms available which allow for authentic engagement with music learning in this manner.</p>
<br>
<h2>Goal Three: Simplify the creation process</h2>
<p>As briefly discussed in the introduction, the creation of music multimedia objects is often very costly, both in time and financial terms. </p>
<p>Creation of a single piece of multimedia content as seen in <a href="index.html">Figure 4</a> can take weeks of time and must be done by somebody with an extensive knowledge of coding and relevant software. </p>
<p>The creative process might look something like this for a similar music multimedia object: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Plan the presentation</li>
  <li>Write the script</li>
  <li>Notate all required passages in Sibelius</li>
  <li>Export and cut up all notation to an image format</li>
  <li>Record audio voiceover for each section</li>
  <li>Acquire or produce any relevant musical audio</li>
  <li>Mix audio voiceover with any musical audio</li>
  <li>Export final audio for each section</li>
  <li>Code the sequence of each section of the object (including UI elements like buttons)</li>
  <li>Generate and manually align closed captioning</li>
  <li>Export the object</li>
  <li>Link to the object from within the learning content as it cannot be embedded</li>
</ul>
<p>By greatly reducing the amount of fine-tuning required by creating a platform for streamlined creation music education multimedia content is able to be more readily produced, at a lower cost and in a shorter span of time. This would also allow music educators who hold the necessary content and pedagogical knowledge to develop resources on their own, rather than having to rely on a third-party such as a web developer or learning designer who might not be able to readily interpret musical phenomena.</p>
