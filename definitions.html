 <h3 style="text-align:left;">Formal Music Learning</h3>
 <p style="text-align:left;">Formal learners in this context refers to learners who are undertaking study in either an educational institution (secondary or tertiary) or through an online provider in a course format (MOOC, etc.). </br> For these learners it is assumed that they are interacting with music education multimedia in a structured fashion such as an online course or classroom environment.</p>
 </br>
 <h3 style="text-align:left;">Informal Music Learning</h3>
 <p style="text-align:left;">Informal learners in this context refers to learners who are utilising standalone educational resources outside the context of an educational institution or online provider in a course format – such as those undertaking more casual self-education online through video-on-demand sites featuring User-Generated Content (Waldron, 2013). </br>For these informal learners it is assumed that interaction with music education multimedia happens in an unstructured fashion, such as an individual video-by-video basis.</p>

 <h3 style="text-align:left;">Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML)</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left;">Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning refers to Richard Mayer and Roxana Moreno's (1999) work surrounding effective multimedia learning based on how the human mind functions. </br>CTML is based on the same principles as John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1998) but is more focused on implications for video, audio, and animation in multimedia learning. CTML has three key assumptions, which I have also assumed to be true for the purposes of this assignment:</p>
  <dl style="text-align:left;">
  <dt ><b>The Dual-Channel Assumption</b></dt>
  <dd>The brain has two separate channels for processing information, a visual and auditory channel. This is referred to as Dual-Coding Theory (See Figure 5)</dd>
  </br>
  <dt><b>The Limited-Capacity Assumption</b></dt>
  <dd>Each of these two channels has an upper-limit to the speed at which it can process information - similar to CLT's concepts of Cognitive Load (Sweller, 1988).</dd>
  </br>
  <dt><b>The Active-Processing Assumption</b></dt>
  <dd>People do not learn by simply absorbing information unconsciously, learning is an active cognitive process in which we must organise and integrate new information with prior knowledge.</dd>
  </br>

<h2>Types of processing</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Extraneous processing</b></dt>
    <dd>“Cognitive processing during learning that does not serve the instructional objective and is caused by poor instructional design.” (Mayer, 2014)</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b>Essential processing</b></dt>
    <dd>“Cognitive processing during learning that is needed to represent the essential presented material in working memory and is caused by the complexity of the material.” (Mayer, 2014)</dd>
    <br>
    <dt><b>Generative processing</b></dt>
    <dd>“Cognitive processing during learning that is aimed at making sense of the essential material in the lesson and is caused by the learner’s motivation to exert effort.” (Mayer, 2014)</dd>
