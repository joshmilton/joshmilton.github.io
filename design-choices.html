  <h1 style ="text-align: center;">Design Choices</h1>
<br>
<h2 style ="text-align: center;">Inclusion of videos of live performance or instructor speaking – split attention</h2>
<p>Choosing to whether to always include instructional/performance video content or not alongside music notation within the visual space was a choice that needed to be made. </p>
<p>Fyfield et al (2022) describe an additional principle to those originally outlined in CTML (Mayer, 2014) in which presentation of the presenter’s face alongside alternative essential visual information can negatively impact learning outcomes. See Figure 10 for an example of the large amount of competing visual information. </p>
<div align = "center";>  <img src="img/Fig10.png" width="50%">
  <p><b>Figure 10:</b> Locker View - Competing visual information of both instructor and musical notation</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Given the notation in any section in which it is included should take precedence as essential visual information this is a clear choice when presenting theoretical or notation-based content.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>However, research on music instruction indicates that mirror neurons are an essential part of the music learning process as musicians’ brains emulate the motor cognition (Fourie, 2004) and emotive states of musicians they are watching (Molnar-Szakacs & Overy, 2006) allowing for deeper processing of musical materials.</p>
<p>Given the differing complexity and learning outcomes of many musical learning tasks, the option should be left in for both a simultaneous and singular display during periods with notation to support effective design of both conceptual and tutorial styles of content, with the usage of this left at the instructional designer’s discretion.</p>
<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Animation to support gradual processing of essential information</h2>
<p>Given the prominence of the temporal dimension in processing music (Peretz & Zatorre, 2005) it seemed appropriate to use animation within the notation to support gradual processing of the complex information by presenting notes as they occur aurally. This may have a similar effect to observing the instructor draw (Fyfield et al, 2022), as well as makes use of the transience principle proposed by Fyfield et al (2022) by slowing the rate at which essential information is presented to the learner. This gradual presentation of visual information in-sync with the aural stimuli also aligns with the temporal contiguity and cueing/signalling principles of CTML (Mayer, 2014; Mayer & Moreno, 2003), as well as with Owens and Sweller’s findings (2008) regarding the benefits of dual-modality presentation in music learning.</p>

</div>
<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Contrast, Signaling and Highlighting</h2>
<p>Further building upon the CTML principle of signalling and the PARC (Williams, 2015) principle of Contrast, highlighting is used as a clear visual means of focusing learner attention on key points in the notation. This is done through the use of highly-contrasting colours on key notes or symbols within the notation, alternative means such as coloured boxes surrounding key content could also be used when indicating larger passages and wanting to maintain visual fidelity of the notation.</p>
<p>Further signalling is done through the use of a marker above the current note during playback of passages, as can be seen above in Figure 12.</p>
<p>The same principles are applied to interactable learning activities within the platform, with student-generated content (such as selected objects, or inserted objects) being displayed in a heavily contrasting colour to the remainder of the notation to provide visual feedback to student interaction.</p>

  <p><b>Figure 13:</b> Notes the student has interacted with display in a contrasting colour.</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>Another form of signalling and highlighting could be done through a blurring and darkening of non-focus materials (See Figure 14), this allows for the context of the focus passage to still be known by the learner while reducing seductive details and extraneous visual information as the additional symbols are now less legible.</p>

<br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">UI Design</h2>
<p>The User Interface and general design of the platform were designed with CTML and PARC principles in mind.</p>
<br>
<h2>Chapter Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>Contrast is seen in multiple aspects of the chapter bar, such as the colouring which denotes visually student progress through the video, and the distinct shapes which differentiate between instructional segments (bars) and activities (egg-shape with star). </p>
<p>Sections which have been watched are displayed in a ‘forest green’ colour, while unwatched sections are in a ‘bone white’ colour, this allows students at a glance to differentiate between what has come and gone and what lays ahead in the multimedia content. The same colouring applies to activity modules, and in progress chapters show their progress by transitioning into the completed colour (See Figure 15).</p>
<br>
<div align = "center";>  <img src="img/Fig15.png" width="50%">
  <p><b>Figure 15:</b> Annotated UI Elements.</p>
</div>
<br><br>

<p>All navigation and learner control elements have been aligned at the bottom of the display, and are visually separated from learning content in the upper portion of the screen to allow for clear delineation between the UI and multimedia content.</p>
<p>During integrated learning activities, additional UI elements which are related to the activity are clearly aligned with the interactive activity elements (See Figure 16) such as notation, and are coloured to indicate whether they are currently active in alignment with the colouring of the user-created elements (e.g. added element is blue, currently selected ‘tool’ is blue). </p>
<p>Other interactable objects such as the ‘Check Answer’ or ‘Continue’ button are only displayed to the user when the correct conditions have been met, e.g. if the learner has input an answer to a question – the Check Answer button is shown, and once the answer has been checked – the Continue button is shown. The positioning and alignment of these navigation features is also repeated in both use cases, allowing learners to easily understand that these buttons are used to move forward in the content.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Interactivity through Learner Control</h2>
<p>As discussed in Hasler et al. (2007) the benefits of providing learners with a means of controlling the speed and flow of multimedia allows for better learning outcomes by allowing learners to move at their own pace through materials, allowing for more time to process instructional information and increase germane cognitive load. The use of chapters and segmentation supports this by providing learners with a clear understanding of the length of chunks of content as well as how far through a piece of content they are, guiding their use of the play and pause features.</p>

<h2>Interactivity through Integrated Learning Activities</h2>
<p>Interactivity and use of integrated learning activities is a cornerstone of effective multimedia design for learning (Fyfield et al, 2022) and is often missing from digital music education, or lacking authenticity when attempted in non-music-specific platforms.</p>
<p>The learning activities allowed for through the inclusion of genuine notation display and modification allows for authentic music learning to occur within the multimedia content, and the simple editing workflow allows for efficient creation of activities. While student input is not always accepted as part of the music instructional process (West & Rostvall, 2003), Mayer et al. (2020) and Fyfield et al. (2022) clearly indicate the advantages of generative activity and interactivity in an instructional video context, allowing students further time to consolidate knowledge and increase active cognitive engagement.</p>
<p>The Drawing principle of CTML may also come in to play as part of these integrated learning activities (See page: <a href="interpreting.html">Interpreting CTML Principles</a>) in establishing deeper learning through creation of pictorial models (via notation) of presented concepts at key points in the sequence, though this is merely an assumption at this point and is not supported by research.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>MIDI Playback</h2>
<p>MIDI playback is an important part of the interactive experience providing immediate feedback for student interaction with the notation editor, bringing their ideas to life. And also allowing for manipulation of playback in notation examples when wanting to for example slow down an excerpt.</p>
<p>As mentioned when discussing the Voice principle (Mayer, 2014; See page: Interpreting CTML Principles), this may not be as effective as authentic musical recordings in facilitating student learning in much the same way that computer-generated or accented speed may be inferior to a non-accented human voice (Fyfield et al, 2022; Mayer, 2014). For this reason, use of MIDI playback should be minimised in favour of genuine musical audio where possible and generally saved for playing back musical material inputted by students.</p>
<p>The difference between genuine audio material and MIDI recreation is clearly audible between Extract 1 and Extract 2 below.</p>
