  <h1 style ="text-align: center;">Design Choices</h1>
<br>
<h2 style ="text-align: center;">Inclusion of videos of live performance or instructor speaking – split attention</h2>
<p>Choosing to whether to always include instructional/performance video content or not alongside music notation within the visual space was a choice that needed to be made. </p>
<p>Fyfield et al (2022) describe an additional principle to those originally outlined in CTML (Mayer, 2014) in which presentation of the presenter’s face alongside alternative essential visual information can negatively impact learning outcomes. See Figure 10 for an example of the large amount of competing visual information. </p>

  <p><b>Figure 10:</b> Locker View - Competing visual information of both instructor and musical notation</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Given the notation in any section in which it is included should take precedence as essential visual information this is a clear choice when presenting theoretical or notation-based content.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>However, research on music instruction indicates that mirror neurons are an essential part of the music learning process as musicians’ brains emulate the motor cognition (Fourie, 2004) and emotive states of musicians they are watching (Molnar-Szakacs & Overy, 2006) allowing for deeper processing of musical materials.</p>
<p>Given the differing complexity and learning outcomes of many musical learning tasks, the option should be left in for both a simultaneous and singular display during periods with notation to support effective design of both conceptual and tutorial styles of content, with the usage of this left at the instructional designer’s discretion.</p>
<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Animation to support gradual processing of essential information</h2>
<p>Given the prominence of the temporal dimension in processing music (Peretz & Zatorre, 2005) it seemed appropriate to use animation within the notation to support gradual processing of the complex information by presenting notes as they occur aurally. This may have a similar effect to observing the instructor draw (Fyfield et al, 2022), as well as makes use of the transience principle proposed by Fyfield et al (2022) by slowing the rate at which essential information is presented to the learner. This gradual presentation of visual information in-sync with the aural stimuli also aligns with the temporal contiguity and cueing/signalling principles of CTML (Mayer, 2014; Mayer & Moreno, 2003), as well as with Owens and Sweller’s findings (2008) regarding the benefits of dual-modality presentation in music learning.</p>

</div>
<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Contrast, Signaling and Highlighting</h2>
<p>Further building upon the CTML principle of signalling and the PARC (Williams, 2015) principle of Contrast, highlighting is used as a clear visual means of focusing learner attention on key points in the notation. This is done through the use of highly-contrasting colours on key notes or symbols within the notation, alternative means such as coloured boxes surrounding key content could also be used when indicating larger passages and wanting to maintain visual fidelity of the notation.</p>
<p>Further signalling is done through the use of a marker above the current note during playback of passages, as can be seen above in Figure 12.</p>
<p>The same principles are applied to interactable learning activities within the platform, with student-generated content (such as selected objects, or inserted objects) being displayed in a heavily contrasting colour to the remainder of the notation to provide visual feedback to student interaction.</p>

  <p><b>Figure 13:</b> Notes the student has interacted with display in a contrasting colour.</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>Another form of signalling and highlighting could be done through a blurring and darkening of non-focus materials (See Figure 14), this allows for the context of the focus passage to still be known by the learner while reducing seductive details and extraneous visual information as the additional symbols are now less legible.</p>
