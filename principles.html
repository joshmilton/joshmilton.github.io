  <h1 style ="text-align: center;">Interpreting CTML Principles</h1>
  <p>Now that we have discussed how music may fit within the Dual-Coding model (See page: <a href="dualcoding.html">CTML Dual-Coding Theory</a>) we can use the assumptions we have made to interpret the principles of CTML as they might apply to music instruction.</p>
  <p>Mayer defines a set of 15 principles for Multimedia Learning in his book “Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning” (Mayer, 2014, p. 63), and describes how each of the techniques should be applied. Each principle is linked to one of the following goals: Minimising extraneous processing, managing essential processing, or fostering generative processing.</p>

<p>While many of these principles apply in their normal fashion when exploring music instruction through the lens of CTML, a number of these principles have interesting implications when considered in this context.</p>
<p>Looking at some of these principles through the lens of existing literature provides some insight into how we might interpret them to support music learning in a multimedia environment.</p>
<br>
<h2>Application of Redundancy, Temporal Contiguity, and Dual-Modality</h2>
<p>While Mayer and other CTML researchers suggest that adding printed text to spoken text creates a redundancy effect (Mayer, 2014, p. 282; Fyfield et al., 2022), crowding limited cognitive space - this may not always be the case for simultaneous aural and visual representations of music. Owens and Sweller (2008) describe a lack of redundancy effect seen in novice musicians when presented with simultaneous visual (notation) and aural musical material, though redundancy could possibly still in expert musicians. </p>
<p>Due to the complex nature of decoding music notation and subsequent creation of an aural approximation of the music may in fact not result in redundancy even in expert musicians, as the materials are used in a dual-modality format to support construction of mental models of the music. Dual-modality study of musical works is also common in most traditional music education environments.</p>

<p>As suggested in Owens and Sweller's work (2008), the simultaneous dual-modality of both visual and aural musical stimuli may in fact assist in developing mental schema of musical concepts or figures. The pair also note that this dual-modality observed in their study is likely only effective due to the temporal contiguity of the two presentations, with little connection able to be drawn when the stimuli are not presented in tandem or close temporal proximity.</p>
<br>
<h2>Exploring Voice and Drawings</h2>
<p>Mayer (2014, p.357) notes that unnatural or unfamiliar voices, such as computer-generated voices or unusual accents, in instruction can be harmful to a learner's ability to process information and problem-solve. From a musical perspective, one could theorise that this is due to changes in both the temporal and pitch properties of the speech presented feeling disjointed in comparison to an unaccented and human delivery. It would be interesting to see whether these same downsides of speech patterns/tones also apply to MIDI recreations of musical instruments within aural musical examples - does using a digital piano sound rather than a recording of a real piano impact upon student learning in the same manner or would the consistent pitch and temporal quality mitigate these effects?</p>
<p>One could also theorise that due to the pictorial nature of music notation, the generative drawing principle (Mayer, 2014; Leutner & Schmeck, 2014) might also apply to creating pictorial models of musical concepts through notation.</p>
